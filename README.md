CASE INCIDENT 1 L’Oréal around the Globe With more than 88,000 employees and a massive presence 
spread across 150 countries on five
With more than 88,000 employees and a massive presence spread across 150 countries on five 
continents of the globe, L’Oréal is the world’s largest beauty company. The company has had a successful 
global expansion strategy since its inception, growing from a local producer of a hair dye for French 
hairdressers in 1909 to a global giant today. Around the globe, the company has a mix of different 
operations, ranging from corporate offices, to manufacturing sites, to distribution centers, to retail stores. 
In line with its expansion strategy, the company has acquired numerous popular beauty companies and 
brands over the years, including European, American, and Asian brands. According to L’Oréal, this aspect 
of its expansion strategy is especially important for bolstering its brand portfolio and ensuring future 
organic growth
However, global expansion has its own challenges, among which is successfully managing employees 
across cultures and regions, all separated by different norms, languages, and traditions. There are many 
examples of companies that have failed in foreign markets due to their inability to manage the cultural 
differences among their global units and establish effective communication between its international 
subsidiaries. According to Geert Hofstede, a Dutch social psychologist known for his pioneering research 
on cross-cultural groups, there are cultural differences between different countries and regions, 
especially between Western and Eastern cultures. Similarly, Jeanne M. Brett, a professor at the Kellogg 
School of Management, notes that communication styles vary from one culture to another, which can 
increase the possibilities of conflict and misunderstanding between employees from different cultures. 
In fact, a recent study by L’Oréal in the United Kingdom found that cultural differences across 
international markets are the biggest reason why employers are unable to provide ample foreign 
assignments to their employees.
Global companies need to create effective strategies that can increase harmony and unity among their 
workers across the globe. They can build cultural sensitivity—being aware and sensitive to the cultural 
differences between different groups of people—by ensuring that employees learn about each other’s 
norms and cultures. L’Oréal has invested heavily in workforce initiatives that aim to build stronger 
connections between its people around the globe. L’Oréal tries to base itself on “global careers” by 
promoting and encouraging its staff to rotate among the company’s locations around the world. The 
result is stronger collaboration and partnerships between different international workgroups that 
contributes to organizational effectiveness in global settings. At its foundation is a strong dedication to 
employee diversity, underpinned by L’Oréal’s long history of building diverse, multicultural teams, raising 
cultural awareness, and improving unity between its people, something that its competitors have found 
much more challenging.
